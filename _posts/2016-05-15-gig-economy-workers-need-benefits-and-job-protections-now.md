  In the us, we lump workers into two categories, employee or independent
  contractor, neither of which were designed for Fasil Teka. Teka, 41, joined
  Uber five years ago in Seattle. He drives roughly 40 hours a week as an
  independent contractor. He's also a party planner and sometimes shuttles
  guests for a local hotel.
