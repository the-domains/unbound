description: "Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, likes to play a game he calls Find the Robot. As he goes about his everyday life-shopping, traveling through airports-he looks for machines performing tasks that humans once handled. Most of what he sees doesn't impress him. ATMs, self-checkout kiosks, and boarding pass scanners have been around for years."
